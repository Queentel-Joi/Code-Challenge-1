## How to Run and Test

These JavaScript solutions utilize functions like `prompt()` for user input and `console.log()` for output, which are typically available in web browser environments. To run them, you can use a web browser's developer console directly:

1.  **Open your web browser.**
2.  **Open the Developer Console:**
    * On most browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari): Press `F12` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).
    * Navigate to the "Console" tab within the developer tools.
3.  **Paste the JavaScript code:**
    Copy the entire JavaScript code for the specific challenge you want to test and paste it directly into the console's input area.
4.  **Press Enter:**
    The script will execute immediately. A `prompt()` dialog box will appear, asking for your input.
5.  **Interact and View Output:**
    Enter the required value in the prompt. The results of the calculations will be displayed directly in the "Console" tab.
